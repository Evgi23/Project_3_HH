### Project Description
HeadHunter aims to develop a model capable of automatically estimating an applicant's approximate salary range based on the information provided in their resume. However, before building the model, the data must be thoroughly explored and cleaned

### What case we are solving?
The project consists of 4 main parts:

1 Preliminary Data Analysis: We performed an initial exploration of the data to identify its key characteristics and structure.

2 Detailed Job Analysis: Conducted an in-depth review of job postings to uncover the most common employer requirements and calculate average salaries

3 Employer Analysis: Identified the top 5 companies with the highest number of job postings.

4 Domain-Specific Analysis: Analyzed job postings related to Data Science (DS) professionals, including the number of requested skills, and calculated average salaries for both entry-level and experienced specialists.



**Competition conditions**


**Quality metric**
The goal of the project is to gain an understanding of the data and evaluate its alignment with the objectives for building a machine learning model.

**What we practice**
Throughout the project, SQL queries were used to interact with the database. All queries were documented and organized within a Jupyter Notebook.

### Conclusions
In this project, we learned how to write SQL queries, properly document them in a notebook, create clear documentation, and successfully add another project to our portfolio.
